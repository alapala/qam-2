In order to get rolling you have to go to your SAS data/working
directory (`SASHOME') and create three folders corresponding to
your three data libraries:

	(1) 'Data', which holds original data sets we get from WRDS;

	(2) 'Workspace', which holds data sets that we generate and
	    that we wish to use repeatedly; and

	(3) 'Results', which contains the end results of our
	    computations.

Having a 'Workspace' data library saves us some time when we
revisiting the project, since SAS purges its temporary 'Work'
directory each time you close the application.

Lastly before you run any code, make sure you replace instances of
`SASHOME' within the code with your actual SAS data/working directory.
